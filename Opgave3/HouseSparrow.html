            <h1> About House Sparrows </h1>
      

            <h2>Color pattern</h2>
            <p>Male House Sparrows are brightly colored birds with gray heads, white cheeks, a black bib, and 
            rufous neck – although in cities you may see some that are dull and grubby. Females are a plain 
            buffy-brown overall with dingy gray-brown underparts. Their backs are noticeably striped with buff, 
            black, and brown.</p>

            <h2>Behaviour</h2>
            <p>House Sparrows are noisy sparrows that flutter down from eaves and fencerows to hop and peck at crumbs 
            or birdseed. Look for them flying in and out of nest holes hidden behind shop signs or in traffic lights, 
            or hanging around parking lots waiting for crumbs and picking insects off car grills.</p>
            
            <h2>Habitat</h2>
            <p>House Sparrows have lived around humans for centuries. Look for them on city streets, taking handouts in parks 
            and zoos, or cheeping from a perch on your roof or trees in your yard. House Sparrows are absent from undisturbed 
            forests and grasslands, but they’re common in countryside around farmsteads.</p>
