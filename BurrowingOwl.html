            <h1> About the Burrowing Owl </h1>
            The facial disc is pale brownish with prominent white eyebrows above the bright yellow eyes. The 
            bill is greyish-olive and the cere greyish-brown. There is a distinct whitish throat band.
            Upperparts are brown, with the forehead and crown having whitish streaks and dots. Elsewhere is 
            irregularly dotted whitish to pale ochre with relatively large, rounded spots. Flight feathers are 
            barred light and dark, and the tail is brown has 3-4 pale bars.
            Underparts are whitish to pale buff with dense dusky brown bars.
            Tarsi are conspicuously long and sparsely feathered. The olive-grey toes are bristled, and the claws 
            are dark horn with blackish tips.
            Females are usually darker than the males.



            <h2>Habits</h2>
            Burrowing owls generally active at dusk and dawn, but sometimes at night also. They are highly 
            terrestrial, and are often seen perched on a mound of dirt, telegraph or fence post - frequently on 
            one foot. They bob up and down when excited. Flight is with irregular, jerky wingbeats and they 
            

            <h2>Breeding</h2>
            Bald eagles are believed to mate for life. A pair constructs an enormous stick nest—one of the bird-
            world's biggest—high above the ground and tends to a pair of eggs each year. Immature eagles are 
            dark, and until they are about five years old, they lack the distinctive white markings that make their 
            parents so easy to identify. Young eagles roam great distances. Florida birds have been spotted in 
            Michigan, and California eagles have traveled all the way to Alaska.
