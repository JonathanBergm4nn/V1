# V1-HTML-course "Birds" 
This is a website made for a course at AspIT Sønderjylland, to learn about HTML. 

## Screenshots from test-site
Index.html of the bird lexicon. Very basic formatting with the birds in a line down with a link to their own page both as text but the pictures are links aswell to each respective bird page.

HairyWoodpecker.html - here showing more formatting using lists , paragraphs and with a back link 
back to the index.html aswell as a link that will open in a new tab the wikipedia page of the bird.

Screenshots are taking with the croppingtool provided by windows10, i've cropped anything not related to the site out. Screenshots are made in Chrome in Darkmode, so the background of the site is not black with white text FYI

### Ending note.
coded exclusively in HTML using Visual Studio, plans are to format it further later in development in CSS.
