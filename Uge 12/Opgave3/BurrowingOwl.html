            <h1> About the Burrowing Owl </h1>
            <p>The facial disc is pale brownish with prominent white eyebrows above the bright yellow eyes. The 
            bill is greyish-olive and the cere greyish-brown. There is a distinct whitish throat band.
            Upperparts are brown, with the forehead and crown having whitish streaks and dots. Elsewhere is 
            irregularly dotted whitish to pale ochre with relatively large, rounded spots. Flight feathers are 
            barred light and dark, and the tail is brown has 3-4 pale bars.
            Underparts are whitish to pale buff with dense dusky brown bars.
            Tarsi are conspicuously long and sparsely feathered. The olive-grey toes are bristled, and the claws 
            are dark horn with blackish tips.
            Females are usually darker than the males.</p>


            <h2>Habits</h2>
            <p>Burrowing owls generally active at dusk and dawn, but sometimes at night also. They are highly 
            terrestrial, and are often seen perched on a mound of dirt, telegraph or fence post - frequently on 
            one foot. They bob up and down when excited. Flight is with irregular, jerky wingbeats and they 
            will frequently make long glides, interspersed with rapid wingbeats. Burrowing Owls are 
            comparatively easy to see because they are often active in daylight, and can be surprisingly bold 
            and approachable.</p>


            <h2>Hunting & Food</h2>
            <p>Burrowing Owls feed on a wide variety of prey, changing food habits as location and time of year 
            determine availability. Large arthropods, mainly beetles and grasshoppers, comprise a large portion 
            of their diet. Small mammals, especially mice, rats, gophers, and ground squirrels, are also 
            important food items. Other prey animals include: reptiles and amphibians, scorpions, young 
            cottontail rabbits, bats, and birds, such as sparrows and horned larks. These Owls are quite versatile 
            in the ways they capture prey. They chase down grasshoppers and beetles on the ground, use their 
            talons to catch large insects in the air, or hover in mid-air before swooping down on unsuspecting 
            prey. They also watch from perches, then glide silently toward their target. Burrowing Owls are 
            primarily active at dusk and dawn, but will hunt throughout a 24-hour period, especially when they 
            have young to feed.</p>
