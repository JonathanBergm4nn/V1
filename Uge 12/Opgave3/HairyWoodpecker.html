            <h1> About the Hairy Woodpecker  </h1>
          

            <h2>Identification</h2>
            <p>Plumage pattern is nearly identical to the downy’s, with long white patch down the back, variable 
            white spotting on the wing coverts and flight feathers, and mostly unmarked underparts. The outer 
            tail feathers are usually unmarked white. Adult: male shows red nuchal bar, often divided vertically 
            by black (especially in some eastern populations); red is lacking in female.</p>

            <h2>Voice</h2>
            <p>Call: a piercing, sharp peek or pee-ik. The rattle call (“whinny”) is a fast, slightly descending series 
            of these peek calls. Drum: rapid roll of about 25 beats in 1 second.</p>

            <h2>Status and Distribution</h2>
            <p>Fairly common; uncommon to rare in the South and Florida. Year-round: the hairy occupies a wide range of 
            coniferous and deciduous forests from sea level to tree line; such habitats are usually densely wooded, 
            but in some areas are more open and parklike. Dispersal: although generally nonmigratory, individuals 
            can disperse long distances, and small irruptive movements sometimes occur. Larger, more northerly birds 
            regularly occur in the Northeast in fall and winter. Recorded in fall and winter on the southern plains 
            and Pacific coast lowlands well away from breeding habitats.</p>
