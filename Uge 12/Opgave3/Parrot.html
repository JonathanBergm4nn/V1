            <h1> About Parrots  </h1>
            <p>The parrots are a broad order of more than 350 birds. Macaws, Amazons, lorikeets, lovebirds, 
            cockatoos and many others are all considered parrots.</p>

            <h2>Shared Traits </h2>
            <p>Though there is great diversity among these birds, there are similarities as well. All parrots 
            have curved beaks and all are zygodactyls, meaning they have four toes on each foot, two pointing 
            forward and two projecting backward. Most parrots eat fruit, flowers, buds, nuts, seeds, and some 
            small creatures such as insects.</p>
            
            <p>Parrots are found in warm climates all over most of the world. The greatest diversities exist in 
            Australasia, Central America, and South America.</p>


            <h2>Popularity as Pets </h2>
            <p>Many parrots are kept as pets, especially macaws, Amazon parrots, cockatiels, parakeets, and 
            cockatoos. These birds have been popular companions throughout history because they are intelligent, 
            charismatic, colorful, and musical. Some birds can imitate many nonavian sounds, including human 
            speech. The male African gray parrot (Psittacus erithacus) is the most accomplished user of human 
            speech in the animal world; this rain forest-dweller is an uncanny mimic.</p>
            
            <h2>Threats to Survival</h2>
            <p>Currently the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) bans the sale of any 
            wild-caught species, yet the parrots' popularity continues to drive illegal trade.</p>
            
            <p>Some parrot species are highly endangered. In other cases, once tame birds have reproduced in the 
            wild and established thriving feral populations in foreign ecosystems. The monk (green) parakeet, 
            for example, now lives in several U.S. states.</p>
